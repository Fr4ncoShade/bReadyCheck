# **bReadyCheck (beta)**  
bReadyCheck is a lightweight and user-friendly addon for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5) that extends the default raid ready check functionality.  
Helpful addon for raiders, especially for raid leaders and officers.  
It is based on the visual style and ideas of Method Raid Tools (MRT).

## **Features**  
- Raid ready check with display of missing buffs, including:
  - Food buff  
  - Flask  
  - Key raid buffs (Intellect, Stamina, etc.)
- Supports both automatic and manual activation of the buff check window.  
  
## **How to Use**  
Run a standard ready check using the command:  
`/readycheck`  
This will automatically open the window showing buff status for all raid members.  
  
To open the buff check window manually (without starting a ready check), use:  
`/brc`  

To close the buff check window, simply right-click anywhere on the frame.
